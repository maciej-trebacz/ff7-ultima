This project is a Tauri 2.0 app that uses Rust on the backend (src-tauri directory) and TypeScript for the frontend (src directory). The TypeScript part utilizes shadcn-ui components and TailwindCSS for styling. The UI uses a dark theme with "slate" base color. When writing UI code make sure it's sleek and compact, use small buttons and minimal padding.

## Installing shadcn components

To add a new shadcn component to the project run the command:

npx shadcn@latest add [component name here]

## Updating to a new version (build for release)

To update to a new version several edits need to be made:

1. Update the app version number in `src/Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, and `tauri.conf.json`.
2. Run the build.ps1 script (this should be done by the user manually)
3. Update the `updater.json` file with the new version number in the `version` field and also in the `url` field, update the `signature` using contents of the file: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/FF7 Ultima_[version]_x64-setup.exe.sig`
4. Ask the user for a commit message and then perform `git add .` and commit changes with message "Version [version], [user message]" (do not include the files in ff7-lib as they're outside of this repo)
5. Tag this commit as "[version]" and push it to origin, both the commit and the new tag
