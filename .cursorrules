This project is a Tauri 2.0 app that uses Rust on the backend (src-tauri directory) and TypeScript for the frontend (src directory). The TypeScript part utilizes shadcn-ui components and TailwindCSS for styling. The UI uses a dark theme with "slate" base color. When writing UI code make sure it's sleek and compact, use small buttons and minimal padding.

## Updating to a new version (build for release)

To update to a new version several edits need to be made:

1. Update the app version number in `src/Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, and `tauri.conf.json`.
2. Update the lib version in `../ff7-lib/Cargo.toml` to the same version number
3. Run the build.ps1 script (this should be done by the user manually)
4. Update the `updater.json` file with the new version number in the `version` field and also in the `url` field, update the `signature` using contents of the file: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/FF7 Ultima_[version]_x64-setup.exe.sig`
5. Ask the user for a commit message and then stage and commit all changes with message "Version [version], [user message]"
6. Tag this commit as "[version]" and push it to origin, both the commit and the new tag
